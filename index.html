If you are an employer, and especially if you are an owner of a small business, you may want to consider that if you aren't normally doing background screenings on potential employees, you could be putting yourself, your business and other employees at risk. Hiring the best people and working with the top suppliers can be crucial for your organization's success. A good screening service will offer a broad range of services to help you reduce workforce and workplace risk. These various employment screening services help detect possible issues — like past criminal records, resume exaggerations, drug use, employer sanctions and poor performance histories — before they can pose a threat to your company. </strong>  </p>
